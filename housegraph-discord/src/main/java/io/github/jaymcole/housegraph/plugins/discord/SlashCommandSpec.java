 * How a slash command should be registered and answered: its {@code name},

 * is <em>deferred</em> — before the graph runs — so it travels with the command's
 * registration rather than being decided at reply time.

 * @param name        the command name Discord registers it under
 * @param description the command's description, shown in Discord's command picker
 * @param ephemeral   whether the reply is visible only to the person who ran the command
