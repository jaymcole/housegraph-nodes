/**
 * Launches and supervises an external <b>Node.js</b> server as a child process — the long-lived
 * resource behind a Node-server node, the sibling of {@link LocalWebServer}. Where
 * {@code LocalWebServer} serves static files from the JVM itself, this class hands hosting to a
 * user-supplied Node program (an Express app, a Vite dev server, whatever {@code npm start}
 * runs) and only owns its <em>lifecycle</em>: spawn it in the chosen project directory, stream
 * its console output into HouseGraph's log, and kill it (and its child tree) on stop.
 * <p>
 * It <em>does not</em> bind the HTTP port — the Node process does. HouseGraph still advertises
 * {@code <name>.local} over jmdns multicast DNS pointing at the declared port, so the site is
 * reachable at {@code http://<name>.local:<port>/} from any mDNS-aware device — but the Node app
 * is responsible for actually listening on that port (typically via {@code process.env.PORT},
 * which this class sets). If they disagree, the advertisement points nowhere.
 * <p>
 * Like {@code LocalWebServer}, this class keeps no UI concerns: {@link #start} spawns the process
 * and joins the multicast group (call it off the UI thread — process launch and mDNS setup touch
 * the OS and network), {@link #stop} tears both halves down and is idempotent. Instances are
 * single-use per run but reusable after {@link #stop}.
