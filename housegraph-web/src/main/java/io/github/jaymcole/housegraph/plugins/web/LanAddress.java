/**
 * Picks the local IPv4 address to advertise over mDNS — shared by every web-hosting resource
 * ({@link LocalWebServer}, {@link NodeProcessServer}) so the choice is made one way. jmdns
 * needs a concrete interface address, not the wildcard, and it must be the address the LAN can
 * actually reach: getting it wrong means {@code <name>.local} resolves to an unroutable address
 * even though the server is up.
 * <p>
 * The reliable way is to ask the OS which source address it would use to reach the network: a
 * UDP socket "connected" to a remote address does a route lookup (without sending anything) and
 * binds to the chosen source. That picks the real Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface and sidesteps virtual
 * adapters (WSL, Hyper-V) and link-local ({@code 169.254.x}) addresses that
 * {@link NetworkInterface} enumeration can't reliably tell apart ({@code isVirtual()} only flags
 * sub-interfaces, not virtual NICs). Falls back to interface enumeration, then the default local
 * host, if there's no route.
